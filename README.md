# 2.Electrical-Circuit-Identification
In this project I identified an electrical circuit based on the impulse and step responses.


## System identification

Here we can see the electrical equipments used:

In these picture we can see the identification of the system basen on the impulse and step responses.The green signal is the system identified with 99% accuracy.

## Getting Started
You can find the documentation of this project in the .rar file.You can see the data acquisition in .scv files and the code I wrote in matlab for identification of electrical circuit in .m files.
  
## Programming Language
